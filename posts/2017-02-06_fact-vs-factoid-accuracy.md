[big]**Last week’s [piece on disc rot](http://tedium.co/2017/02/02/disc-rot-phenomenon/)** drew a bunch of attention from a variety of media outlets, along with some online critics that weren’t convinced that discs actually rot, based on their personal experience. (I put up [a response regarding that](https://twitter.com/ShortFormErnie/status/827863967020306432) over on Twitter.) But one reader’s comment caught my attention …[/big]

“Dude, I don't think the word ‘factoid’ means what you think it does,” writer 15 Percent Faster informed us. 

He’s right, and we’ll take the blame. As it turns out, while [a very common use of factoid](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/factoid) is “a briefly stated and usually trivial fact,” the original use of the term is exactly the opposite: “an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print.”

I’m not the only person to make this mistake. *Fusion* writer Alexis Madrigal, while he was still with *The Atlantic*, received a similar note when he used “factoid” in the same way I did, and a reader complained, noting that the “-oid” ending represents an object that seems to represent the subject (in this case a fact), but isn’t actually a match. The term came to being in [the 1973 Norman Mailer biography *Marilyn*](http://amzn.to/2jNaeqc), under its original meaning—but in our news-heavy culture, its meaning morphed in a interesting way.

As I wrote last year [about the singular “they,”](http://tedium.co/2016/08/04/singular-they-grammar-copy-editing/) there are certain words that morph in ways where the rulebook doesn’t keep up with the broader language. But this is a case where the modern culture has taken a word and changed it to literally the opposite meaning.

“Once I knew the original usage, the problem began to stare at me: factOID factOID factOID,” Madrigal wrote. “And now, when the etymology of any word is a single Google search away, it is impossible to feign ignorance.”

So apologies: We used “factoid” when we meant “fact.” But that said, considering our era in which [the veracity of our facts is constantly being challenged](http://tedium.co/2016/12/29/tedium-trends-2017/#thestateofourtediumin2017isbestdefinedbythefactwedontknowwhatfakenewslookslike), maybe factoid is the perfect word for 2017—but just not the way that it’s usually intended.
