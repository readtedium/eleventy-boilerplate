[big]**Welcome to Tedium.** Here's the first issue of the twice-weekly newsletter that's bound to become the only email you read—just in time for New Year's Day. And in honor of everyone's favorite hangover catalyst, we're gonna tell you some crazy crap about the first holiday of the year, as well as the holiday that bookends it. May your internet be functional as you scroll through this message on your electronic reading device of choice. *— Ernie @ Tedium*[/big]

### Five signs 2015 will be better than 2014:
1. **It's now legal to sell [the milk of a water buffalo](http://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09800SB3302enr&GA=98&SessionId=85&DocTypeId=SB&LegID=80481&DocNum=3302&GAID=12&Session=&print=true) in Illinois.** What took you guys so long? Clearly someone's been slacking here. (Also of note in Illinois: Amish drivers in the state [no longer have to get photos](http://qctimes.com/news/state-and-regional/illinois/new-laws-affect-illinois-drivers-starting-this-week/article_eef1a788-5c97-5d1e-a5eb-8588130c3dce.html) on their licenses, for religious reasons.)
2. **Last night, a bus parked its keister** in the streets of Manhattan and hooked drunks into IVs [containing an anti-hangover serum](http://nypost.com/2014/12/30/this-bus-will-cure-75-hangovers-on-new-years-day/). This is the world we live in.
3. **We're using New Year's babies** to [promote our area sports teams](http://www.cleveland.com/osu/index.ssf/2014/12/babies_born_on_new_years_day_i.html) before the big game. Beat the other guy! Yeah!
4. **The Large Hadron Collider** just got a major upgrade [and is now twice as powerful](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/large-hadron-collider-ready-to-delve-even-deeper-than-god-particle-as-it-switches-back-on-at-double-power-9948724.html) as it was when they found the "God particle" a couple of years ago. Your mind is getting blown right now.
5. **Reality television** is [starting to loosen its grip](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/29/the-real-world-reality-tv-decline-scandal-true-detective) on television viewers, and ratings are way down. We've changed our focus to true-crime podcasts instead.

### 29%
[/number]

**The percentage of Jawbone Up users** in the United States [who went to bed before midnight](https://jawbone.com/blog/new-years-eve/) on New Year's Eve last year. That's evidence that wearing a fancy bracelet doesn't automatically make you cool.

![Party patents](https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/04/hjshfl6brehjszcouiuj.jpg)

### Party patent time

**New Year's Day wouldn't matter** if it wasn't for the hard work of the party favor industry, which has ensured that we'll have amazing holidays full of drunken fun for generations to come. Back in 2012, [the heavy partiers at IPWatchdog](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/12/31/essential-new-years-eve-innovations/id=32515/) took a break from the difficult life of tracking patents to show off some of these weird patents. [This device for launching confetti](http://www.google.com/patents/EP1163942A2?cl=en), which hit the European patent office back in 2001, is sorta like carrying around your own personal Andrew W.K. Party 'til you puke.

### The most unwanted 2015 wall calendars

[![Animals with mustaches](https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/04/71b_2BP4jXEzL._SL1001__ny3uj0.jpg)](http://amzn.to/1HXXZey)

#### Wasting away the days
**Let's face it.** The wall calendar is [the phone book](http://www.shedworking.co.uk/2010/10/phone-book-shed.html) of the 2010s. It basically exists to allow soccer moms to put up art in their kitchens. We predict that 2015 is the year the calendar cabal gets disrupted once and for all. (Silicon Valley's gunnin' for you!) With that in mind, check out some of Amazon's most unpopular calendars, [including this gem](http://amzn.to/1HXXZey).

[![Puppy Tails](https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/04/61i9Tt6_2BLrL._SL1001__bv5ohx.jpg)](http://amzn.to/1M59fZp)

#### Puppy Tails
**With calendars** [showing off one different dog butt each month](http://amzn.to/1M59fZp), it's no wonder that Google and Apple are winning the war for our datebook. Note the look of guilt on the bulldog's face. It knows.

[![Rustic Retreat](https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/04/0101_rusticb_ofys6b.jpg)](http://amzn.to/1K2R1Vg)

#### Rustic Racks
**Pretty sure** [this wall calendar](http://amzn.to/1K2R1Vg) was designed to fool lazy shoppers who read "racks" and assume the calendar contains something other than antlers. Clearly, it didn't work.

[![Moms Gone Wild](https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/04/71sazurHZKL._SL1001__wt99uw.jpg)](http://amzn.to/1CzyBv2)

#### Moms Gone Wild
**It took more than 45 years,** but [it looks like The Shaggs](http://www.susanorlean.com/articles/meet_shaggs.html) finally have some competition for the [worst family band ever](http://amzn.to/1CzyBv2). If Frank Zappa was alive, I'm sure he'd sign them to his label.

### Factoid you'll probably forget
You probably know this song—if not by name, then by swell. (If you do know it by name, [you're probably a Pentatonix fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSUFzC6_fp8).) "Carol of the Bells," a popular Christmas carol that you mumbled one time at church, actually started life as a Ukranian New Year's Eve song called "Shchedryk." Peter Wilhousky, a Ukranian immigrant himself, translated it and turned it into a Christmas song.

So, that's Tedium. Our first issue, but (hopefully) not our last. We'll be shoving content into your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday, because everyone knows that those two days are among the dullest of the week. (Oh yeah: Have any topics you'd like to see us cover? [Shoot us an email at readtedium@gmail.com](mailto:readtedium@gmail.com).) See ya next week!
