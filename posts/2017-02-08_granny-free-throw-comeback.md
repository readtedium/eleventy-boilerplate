[big]**Throughout his entire 15-year** playing career, NBA legend Rick Barry was a man without shame.[/big]

He won a lot of accolades for his play, [and was a massively successful star](http://www.nba.com/history/players/barry_bio.html). But he won that success, strangely, by using a style of shot that most people throw out before they reach middle school. See, Barry was an underhand free-throw shooter, and it worked really well for him: For every 10 free throw shots he attempted during his career in the ABA and NBA, he made about nine of them, [a rate that was extremely impressive for its time](http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ft_pct_career.html).

There’s nothing stopping players from throwing their free throws underhanded, other than that it looks incredibly awkward. But a point’s a point, and you can’t argue with the results.

That appears to be something that Barry’s son Canyon Barry is taking to heart at the University of Florida. [*The New York Times* reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/sports/ncaabasketball/underhand-free-throw-rick-barry.html) that Canyon has similarly lived through the mockery and is making a whole lot of free throws by mimicking his dad’s “granny shot” style. Check out this shot of him playing with the College of Charleston in 2012:

And like his dad, you can’t argue with the results: After gaining confidence with the shot style, his shot percentage quickly improved, and this year, [Canyon has a free throw percentage](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/61892/canyon-barry) of 89.2 percent.

“The repetition has kicked in to where I feel like every time I step to the line, I should be making both of them,” he told the *Times*.

With a little help from his lineage, he’s shaping up to be an inspiration for people everywhere who look like idiots while successfully doing what they love.
