[big]**Utensils are the great equalizer.** "I once saw a forklift lift a crate of forks, and it was way too literal for me," late philosopher and one-liner king Mitch Hedberg apparently once said. It may be the deepest thing ever said about forks.[/big]

That's because we generally don't talk about forks very often, or utensils in general, really.

That's despite their extreme prevalence. Everyone has to use a utensil at some point in their lives, whether they're sporks, forks, spoons, or chopsticks. (Unless you're Puck from *The Real World* season 3; he got away with [eating peanut butter with his hands](http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/1105158/real-world-puck.jhtml), because of course he did.)

Perhaps you would think about your utensils more if they were incredibly weird. In that spirit, here are a few utensils you probably hadn't considered eating with until now:

### Three Unusual Utensils

* [![electronic twisting fork](http://tedium.imgix.net/2017/06/0106_fork1.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2iO6ksk) **Let's Twist Again:** If you find the work of twisting your fork around a bunch of noodles tiring, [this electronic fork](http://amzn.to/2iO6ksk) does the dirty work for you. It's the fork for the fork user who has everything.
* [![Pulled Pork Shredder Solid Bear Claws](http://tedium.imgix.net/2017/06/0106_fork2.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2iz9JvV)
 **For messy people:** Are those [pulled-pork-shredding bear claws](http://amzn.to/2iz9JvV) on your firsts, or are you just not happy to see me? [As Alton Brown said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgFeVlw2Ywg) in a *Daily Dot* video, "These things are not meat-shredders; these things are a lifestyle."
* [![Utensil Wall DÃ©cor](http://tedium.imgix.net/2017/06/0106_fork3.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2iz93Xo) **Size counts:** These may look like perfectly normal utensils, [but if you tried to buy them](http://amzn.to/2iz93Xo), you would feel sticker shock by the price ($63 for a single set) and more importantly, the size. These things, designed as wall decor, are nearly 3 feet tall.

**And if you're actually hoping** to ponder this topic some more, author [Bee Wilson's 2013 tome *Consider the Fork: A History of How We Cook and Eat*](http://amzn.to/2iOi7ql) is sure to get you some weird looks as you read along at your local Starbucks.
