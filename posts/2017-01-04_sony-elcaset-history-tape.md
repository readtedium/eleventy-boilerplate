[big]**Start the tape:** Roughly a year and a half ago, I made a pitch that [we were due for a magnetic-tape comeback](http://tedium.co/2015/08/20/magnetic-tape-revival/) similar to the one we’ve seen for vinyl. (I titled it after [a Frank Turner album](http://amzn.to/2iNwj2Y), because Frank Turner is cool.) Now, we haven’t seen that magnetic-tape comeback just yet, but it might help if I did my part by highlighting tape-format obscurities.[/big]

One of those obscurities worth a mention is the Elcaset, just one of Sony’s many attempts to create a new standard of some kind. 

The ‘70s-era format was a middle ground between reel-to-reel tape, which was too bulky for mass consumption, and the already-standardized compact cassette, which was [gaining steam in car stereos](http://tedium.co/2016/11/29/car-stereo-security-lessons/). It solved the weaknesses of the cassette—mainly imperfect sound due to limited space—through sheer size. The device, [as *Ars Technica* notes](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/elcaset-large-cassettes/), was roughly twice the size of the a standard cassette.

So why didn’t it sell? Two reasons: First, Sony made the device with the assumption that cassette tapes wouldn’t get better. With the addition of new materials, such as chromium oxide, the quality of the standard cassette got a lot better, and tape players quickly improved as well.

And the other? [As Techmoan notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkGMJBqZawA) in this 2014 clip, no officially-released pre-recorded music ever came out on the format, meaning that all you could really essentially do with it is record your own music—likely from the radio or a vinyl format—onto a giant tape that you can’t put in your car. (*Ars* notes that this was because Sony at the time did not have a significant content business, something that you definitely couldn’t say about Sony now.)

[The thing disappeared by 1980](http://www.obsoletemedia.org/elcaset/). But on the plus side, they were selling a tape-based product that had already healed the wound. You may have heard of it. It's called the Walkman.
