[big]**Today in Tedium:** It was an explosion that only the aliens saw coming. Exactly 19 years ago today, the film [_Independence Day_](http://amzn.to/1CO39nR) hit theaters and featured perhaps the single most iconic visual effect of the 1990s—a short, but effective shot of The White House getting destroyed by a gigantic alien mothership. The scene is memorable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that it looked pretty realistic. If you're like me, you probably are wondering: How did they get that set to look so, uh, White House-y? And where did they film it, anyway? There are literally tons of films with White House scenes. Clearly, they can't film there. So, are there a ton of White House sets just sitting around at all times, just in case someone wants to do [a reboot of _Dave_](http://amzn.to/1NAOzGG)?_(Spoiler alert: Yes.)_ In honor of our Independence Day, we're talking patriotic film sets. _— Ernie @ Tedium_[/big]

[big]**The number of times** that director Roland Emmerich [has destroyed the White House on film](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-06-28/roland-emmerich-cant-stop-destroying-the-white-house)—first in 1996's _Independence Day_, and later repeating the feat in 2009's _2012_ and 2013's _White House Down_. In 2004's _The Day After Tomorrow_, citing national sentiment at the time, he merely froze the building rather than destroying it. (He may be a one-trick pony, but it's an effective trick!) Meanwhile, Channing Tatum [has been forced to pick up the pieces](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/white-house-down-olympus-has-fallen-washington-destroyed-in-film.html) from an uprooted White House twice—in both _White House Down_ and another 2013 film, _G.I. Joe: Retaliation_. (The building isn't destroyed in the latter film, just invaded.)[/big]

### How they pulled off the iconic _Independence Day_ White House explosion

**For such a impactful explosion,** it wasn't actually all that large in size.

See, _Independence Day_—released at a point when CGI was still relatively young—took the art of model design and put it into overdrive to give the special effects the extra push they needed.

Other parts of the movie went kaboom in miniature as well, but the White House easily had the greatest amount of detail—which is why it's so memorable. It was a 5-foot-tall 1:24 scale model—a replica that was essentially built to be destroyed. To give you an idea of how small that is, here's [a similarly scaled White House model](http://www.ford.utexas.edu/museum/exhibits/wh_miniature/main.html).

"The White House has got such great detail in it that even in the most preliminary tests that we've done, that the White House holds up in extreme close-up," visual effects director Bob Hurrie [noted in a making-of video for _Independence Day_](https://youtu.be/EP1ut8KG5eM?t=7m28s). "So, all of a sudden, this particular miniature is very near and dear to our hearts because it's got such wonderful detail. I don't know if I really wanna blow it up or not!"

The model, built of plaster and molded manually, looks impressively like the real thing despite its small size. But in ways relevant to the filming, that small scale had some key differences that a full-size building wouldn't—particularly, that it goes ablaze extremely quickly.

The solution to this issue is a combination of visual trickery and mathematics. The model was shot with nine different cameras at a variety of speeds, at a total speed of 305 frames per second.

As a result, [a scene that lasted about eight seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eujwxh_r43E) in the film itself only took about a second to shoot, and was then slowed down to the speed necessary for it to look natural to the human eye.

The finished scene was so realistic that Emmerich had to actually edit the scene slightly so people realized that the president and his family were able to get away from the exploding White House unscathed—as a way to help ease the emotional impact of the scene slightly. Not bad for a building the size of a Barbie dream house.

### Five ways TV shows and films made the White House their own house

1. **To better allow for the walk-and-talks** that the show traded in, [_The West Wing_](http://amzn.to/1LGqTS1) had a single floor with wide hallways, despite the fact that [the actual west wing of the White House has two floors](http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/special/wwtv.htm).
2. **The film [_Idiocracy_](http://amzn.to/1GSa2oI)'s White House has a memorably white-trashy exterior**, with a swimming pool, satellite dish, and tire swing depicted outdoors. [The infamous "Brawndo's got what plants crave" scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3boy_tLWeqA) also shows a White House conference room with some particularly hilarious renovation work.
3. **If you're watching [the show _Scandal_](http://amzn.to/1LGU33t)** expecting an accurate White House display, you'll be sorely disappointed. The website Seeing Stars notes that much of the show [is shot around the Los Angeles area](http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Scandal.shtml).
4. **Likewise, _House of Cards_** films many of its scenes in Baltimore, a city with architecture that looks enough like D.C. [that the crew can kind of pull it off](http://www.pushing-pixels.org/2013/12/29/production-design-of-house-of-cards-interview-with-steve-arnold.html).
5. **[The 2012 film _Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter_](http://amzn.to/1CeJ8Mk)** had no chance of being the most historically accurate film about Abraham Lincoln released in 2012 ([look to _Lincoln_](http://amzn.to/1enIkcP) for that), but the film did take care to offer up historical touches to give the film its 19th-century feel. [Production designer François Audouy says](http://audouy.com/of-vampires-patriots/) they shot the White House interior scenes in New Orleans' former city hall. That's cool. Not so cool, however, is the film's [use of CGI for the exterior shots](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/ad/set-design/2012/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-movie-set-design-slideshow_slideshow_item8_9).

### "In fact, our pilot’s Oval Office walls were used on _The West Wing_, and those on the permanent set were in a Nicolas Cage movie—I know this because I saw the words ‘National Treasure’ written in Sharpie on the back of them."

**— Jason Winer,** director of the single-season NBC family comedy _1600 Penn_, which featured Josh Gad as the awkward son of the First Family (and president emeritus Bill Pullman doing the job he was born to do), [discussing the set design of the show](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/1600-penn-bill-pullman-show-401606), which was inspired by an actual trip to the White House. As you can imagine due to the popularity of the subject in film and literature, sets for different White Houses get recycled frequently for different films. For example, the Oval Office created for the film _Dave_ [also showed up in _Hot Shots Part Deux_ and _Clear and Present Danger_](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/movies/oval-offices-by-way-of-hollywood.html), while the Oval Office created for the Aaron Sorkin-written [_The American President_](http://amzn.to/1LGUk6B) had a lengthy second life [in Sorkin's _The West Wing_](http://hookedonhouses.net/2009/01/18/the-american-president-the-west-wing-on-the-big-screen/), along with _Nixon_ and _Independence Day_.

**To be clear,** films aren't the only place where you'll find replicas of the White House. In fact, people have been building their own versions of the president's mancave (and potential ladycave) for years, including a 3/4-size replica that was [built by an Iranian immigrant](https://roadtrippers.com/stories/cant-make-it-to-washington-dc-you-can-visit-the-white-house-in-atlanta-georgia?lat=40.80972&lng=-96.67528&z=5) after he moved to Atlanta.

And if you're not in the United States, no worries, you're in luck: In China, bold developers [have been creating their own White House replicas](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2048096,00.html) for years, some costing as much at $10 million. All those set designers seem like they aren't trying hard enough in that context.

So, note to President Whitmore [for next time](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1628841/): If you find your version of the White House suddenly uninhabitable due to aliens, head down to McLean in Virgnia. [There's a perfectly serviceable replica](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1111-Towlston-Rd-Mc-Lean-VA-22102/51724831_zpid/) there, ready for all your needs.
