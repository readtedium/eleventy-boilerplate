[big]**Three months ago, Tedium writer and pal Andrew Egan** noticed something really interesting—the tale of a children’s storybook television network that existed in the 1980s that was frustratingly incomplete. Specifically, there were no signs of video of this network anywhere, despite the fact that it was active for more than 15 years in one form or another.[/big]

So we made the decision to try to solve this problem. Over the span of one afternoon, Andrew and I emailed one another approximately 200 times, connecting all the pieces of this seemingly insane story together, looking for anything that might lead us to a complete story.  We dug through decades-old newspapers, old books, and searched random YouTube channels of random [VHS recordings of cable airings in Winnipeg](https://www.youtube.com/user/RetroWinnipeg), the location of this network. It started out like a regular Tedium piece, but it felt a lot deeper somehow.

Eventually, this would lead to phone calls, in an effort to track down every possible piece of information we could on this thing. I remember one day calling up the Christian Broadcasting Network on the off chance that their archives went back 30 years and covered the networks they distributed through their satellite feed. I eventually talked to someone at the religious broadcaster’s offices in Virginia Beach who informed me that, unfortunately, they hadn’t kept their old content from that far back—a deep loss of cultural history, whether you’re into religious programming or not.

Eventually, though, we called the right sources. Andrew got a hold of one of the cofounders, and I called the right museum. And the result of that was pay dirt. We found both still images and video of this thing that previously did not have an online presence. It was exciting.

The reason why I bring this up is because, even though I wasn’t the one who actually wrote the story (Andrew did an amazing job), I got a lot out of that process, and I was surprised that the excitement that I felt about helping tell this story did not translate into broader public interest for this tale we had uncovered.

I get it—in the end, [the story of Genesis Storytime](https://tedium.co/2018/04/05/genesis-storytime-cable-channel-history/) is a tale about an obscure cable network few people have heard of—but I still found it bizarre.

Yet, something I spent 10 minutes on as a lark for the same 10 people that usually notice when I tweet something [somehow became this nutso viral phenomenon](https://twitter.com/ShortFormErnie/status/1011570751017713666). It’s especially strange because it’s the [second time it’s happened this year](https://tedium.co/2018/03/01/every-headline-on-the-internet-meme/), and both times I was really making a joke for myself, really. It’s especially absurd because the *New York friggin’ Post* [called my grabbing of stock photos “investigative reporting,”](https://nypost.com/2018/06/26/new-photos-spring-up-from-distracted-boyfriend-meme-star/) at a time when *actual* investigative reporting is getting starved for resources.

I mean, certainly there’s a novel nature to it, but I just find it so bizarre sometimes that the silliest thing I write can go nuts, while something I and my fellow contributors actually put a ton of effort into feels kinda like a flop from a traffic perspective, even when it feels both important and creatively fulfilling.

I think that the process of creation is a maddeningly inconsistent process. I created this site as a response to the desire of traffic at all costs, admittedly, but if I could get even five percent of the people that saw that meme I accidentally created the other day to feel the excitement about discovering something hidden and forgotten, the world would be a much better place.

That thread gave a lot of people a laugh, which was great. I hope, though, that humor leads to curiosity for some. Because we need more curious people, even when it comes to the things that seem like small potatoes in a world where things feel increasingly dire. Curiosity means that you’re always learning and looking for new things.

I know this might be a shocking sentiment, but maybe that’s what we need, internet.
