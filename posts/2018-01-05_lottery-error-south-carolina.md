[big]**If a lottery system screws up,** should the winners who benefited from that screwup win the prize they unwittingly earned?[/big]

That’s the question that officials from the South Carolina Education Lottery are currently grappling with after last month [producing a whole lot of winning tickets](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/29/us/south-carolina-lottery-error/index.html) by accident through its Holiday Cash Add-A-Play game. On Christmas day, the game produced thousands of tickets over a two-hour period that produced a winner for each game.

That means that every single ticket, with a maximum cash prize of $500, was suddenly the world’s greatest investment for a little while. It was like Bitcoin with less risk.

However, now that it’s no longer Christmas and the lottery system is in a position to figure out what happened, [regulators have been trying to figure out](http://amzn.to/2CViHxR) if they have to pay out the roughly $20 million in tickets they unwittingly sold that day.

[Fox 46, based in nearby Charlotte, North Carolina](http://www.fox46charlotte.com/news/local-news/bungled-sc-lottery-game-likely-illegal-potential-20m-payout-to-winners), believes, based on an analysis of state law, that the issue is cut-and-dry: The state legally cannot pay out the money because it’s clear that tickets were printed in error.

“It is a no-win situation. If South Carolina Education lottery officials pay out the millions to players who ‘won,’ they would likely be breaking the law,” [the station argues in a report](http://www.fox46charlotte.com/news/local-news/bungled-sc-lottery-game-likely-illegal-potential-20m-payout-to-winners). “If they don’t, they could have a lot of angry players to deal with.”

Despite that, the lottery system [currently has more than $19 million set aside](http://wspa.com/2018/01/02/sc-education-lottery-commission-wants-to-investigate-lotto-glitch-before-paying-out/) in case it decides, well, it should probably pay all those people who benefited from the lottery’s screw-up.

Lottery errors appear to be fairly common, though perhaps not at the scale of the South Carolina mishap. Just this week, [the Connecticut Lottery revealed](http://fox61.com/2018/01/02/error-prompts-connecticut-lottery-to-redraw-new-years-game/) that it had mistakenly failed to include 100,000 tickets in a New Year’s drawing, leading the state to do a separate drawing that will let prior ticket-holders play again.

However, a similar error to the one that befell South Carolina actually [happened in Virginia about a decade ago](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/20/AR2008102001367.html), when a programming error led the state’s lottery to print more than 600 winning tickets worth a $7,777 price tag.

In the end, [Virginia paid out a quarter of the total](https://www.lotterypost.com/news/183827) to winners.
