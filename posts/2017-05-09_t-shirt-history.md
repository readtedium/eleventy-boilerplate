[big]**When Amory Blaine decided** to pack a T-shirt before heading to boarding school, he set in place a piece of literary history. Amory, the protagonist of [F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *This Side of Paradise*](http://amzn.to/2pYazZ7), was the first literary character to use a T-shirt, ever.[/big]

“So early in September Amory, provided with ‘six suits summer underwear, six suits winter underwear, one sweater or T shirt, one jersey, one overcoat, winter, etc.,’ set out for New England, the land of schools,” [the passage states](https://books.google.com/books?id=cJ9aAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA23).

It’s small, a modest scene-setter, but one that has had a lot of cultural impact since, and while the fabric, once called the “crew-neck,” had some historic precedent [in the late 19th century](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/magazine/who-made-that-t-shirt.html), it didn’t really take off until the U.S. Navy started handing them out in 1913—a modest undershirt [that eventually defined the way we dress](https://www.thestar.com/life/fashion_style/2013/08/02/the_tshirt_turns_100.html).

Soon enough, the military’s interest in these shirts led to stuff being printed on them, with a notable early example coming in 1942, when *Life* magazine [featured 23-year-old Corporal Alexander Le Gerda wearing a shirt](https://thecavenderdiary.com/2014/02/03/life-magazine-july-13-1942/) that said “Air Corps Gunnery School, Las Vegas, Nevada.” (Clearly there was a gun there, too, but we're focused on the shirt, [which is shockingly still for sale](http://amzn.to/2petgIU).)

From there, interest when far beyond the military. Soon, you had pop-culture icons trying them on for size (James Dean, Elvis, etc.), and eventually merchandising them like crazy, [as The Beatles did in 1964](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10859583/).

But perhaps the real turning point for printing stuff on shirts came in 1960, when Michael Vasilantone came up with a process for mass-producing screen-printed T-shirts, designing some of the most important technology in that general direction and selling it with his wife Fannie, [under the name Vastex International](http://www.vastex.com/About-Us/About-Us.php). He didn’t need to print the shirts—he had the machinery.

“I was printing as a hobby, but the machinery was a very integral part of the business,” Vasilantone [recalled in a 1990 article](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10860189/) in the Hazleton, Pennsylvania, *Standard-Speaker*. “It forced me to develop the machinery. I found I could make more money making the machines than printing. I developed equipment that was badly needed.”

From there, we got newer, better technology, [dropped the tags](http://tedium.co/2016/05/31/clothing-tags-why-they-exist/), and had some [depressing CafePress memories](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150917/11350332285/ben-carsons-lawyer-threatens-cafepress-because-ben-carson-supporters-are-creating-t-shirts-supporting-carson.shtml) that are best forgotten about, and now we’re here, in an era when [alternative rockers sell more T-shirts than albums](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2014/09/09/youre-selling-t-shirts-genre/).

We just needed the right name for these magical cotton devices. Hence, the T-shirt.

*By the way, it’s worth noting that until May 11, we’re selling some T-shirts, along with other gear, to support Tedium! [Learn more here](https://vacord.com/tedium/).*
