[big]**Back in 2010, *Inc.* contributor Josh Spiro** [made this point](https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/06/best-business-cards.html) about the importance of business cards: “A snazzy card is no good if you hand it out left and right without an exchange of pleasantries and ideas, but a poor quality card can undermine even the best rapport or the most persuasive conversation.”[/big]

With this in mind, it only makes sense that someone had the idea of creating a business card that doubled as a CD-ROM. The CD-ROM, as I’ve pointed out numerous times on Tedium, was [a bit of a game-changer](http://tedium.co/2017/07/13/who-killed-the-encyclopedia/) for obvious reasons, but folks often had [a tendency to take things way too far](http://tedium.co/2016/02/23/cd-rom-magazines-launch-blender/).

And one of the ways they took things too far was by producing miniature CD-ROMs in the shape of a business card. As the Museum of Obsolete Media explains, [the cards generally held](http://www.obsoletemedia.org/business-card-cd-rom/) a fairly miniscule amount of data, less than 100 megabytes, and were an offshoot of the shaped CD, which had gained some interest as a late-90s novelty among rock bands.

It was an idea a lot of companies all had at the same time—for example, Bizemedia in Australia, which produced its own version of the cards around 1999:

These were very much of the era—the kind of tchotchke that you’d pick up at a trade show, look at once, and never use again.

[As a 2000 patent](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2000052685A1) for the device explained, the value of the approach was intended an improvement of the business card for the modern day:

> There remains a need for another type of business card that provides more information than conventional business cards, in the form of a CD-ROM which is compact in size and can be placed in conventional CD-ROM trays for transmitting information by the CD-ROM player. Such a CD-ROM business card can be used in place of a conventional business card and other materials to convey detailed information about a company or product, such that company information or product data on the CD-ROM may be displayed on a monitor of a PC or for audio transmission on a CD-ROM player.

And that wasn’t even the only patent out there for this basic idea, which doesn’t even work in slot-loaded CD-ROMs—like, y'know, every disc drive built into a Mac since the end of the '90s.

The concept, which is [still sold by some CD-R vendors today](http://amzn.to/2v12LX7), was absurd enough [that *Dilbert* parodied it](http://dilbert.com/strip/2000-03-27) back in 2000—and when you’re being parodied by Scott Adams, you know the idea is bottom of the barrel.

Was this format a good idea even when everyone still had a CD-ROM drive in their computer?
